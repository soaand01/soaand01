Currently getting paid to resolve critical issues with Cloud Computing and Kubernetes. I also own a YouTube channel, actually I am learning every time about it, how to edit and these kind of things, but I love to share knowledge doesn't matter how, so I try to broadcast my audiance to multiple platforms and also som blog posts. You might be curious about the channel, I know :) so "[@landudigital][youtube]"
